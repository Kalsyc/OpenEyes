CS4240 GroupProject

Mental health issues are increasingly rampant amongst people today. In fact 1 in 7 people in Singapore has experienced some form of mental disorder. SafeSpace is a VR mental health solution that aims to bring a greater level of understanding for anyone suffering from anxiety disorders as well as brings relief. With the anxiety simulator, users step in the shoes of a typical person suffering from anxiety in a stressful yet familiar office situation. To counter the intensity of the simulator, SafeSpace also has a mindfulness solution in the form of a VR meditation guide.
